I have read about [Jekyll][jekyll] a while back, actually I read a blog post about it on the [github blog][gh-blog]. I installed it a while ago on my Macbook and forgot about it in the meanwhile. But since I need to up my skills in *"webdesign"*, I thought it might be a good time to get used to jekyll and at the same time do some layout stuff.

On top of that I'm going to try out [twitters bootstrap framework][bootstrap] to build a decent looking website and maybe get a feeling for a couple other css/js frameworks.

All of that I will host at [github][gh] (awesome free repository hosting btw!) and its [pages][gh-pages] service. This enables me to write a generic blog and also have specific pages for my simple projects, to share information about those.
